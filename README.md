# 🌞 Invocation

### *Coding as prophecy, scaling as ritual, legacy as code.*

## 📜 Current Scrolls
- **🌿 Exotic Herbs Atlas** → Scaling a luxury herbs business from $600K to $30M+ revenue, ritualized in code.

## 🌍 Legacy Vision
By 2026, this archive will stand as a **poetic atlas** of expansion:  
- Rent-free housing for orphans & the homeless  
- Global Qur’anic verse map  
- Symbolic branding for nurse-led companies  
- Ritual ladders of abundance
