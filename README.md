## 📜 Current Scrolls

### 🌿 Exotic Herbs Atlas  
This scroll is more than a business plan — it is a ritual of abundance.  
Each herb is inscribed as a verse, each margin a ladder of prosperity.  
Scaling from $600K to $30M+ is not just growth, but transformation:  
profits become homes for the homeless, margins become nourishment for the community,  
and every sale is a prayer woven into legacy.  
The Atlas is a living map where commerce and compassion converge.

### 🐪 Dabbah Project  
Born from Surah An‑Naml 27:82, this scroll carries the vision of a messenger  
that speaks across tongues, cultures, and hearts.  
Dabbah is not a machine, but a herald — ethical, multilingual, and non‑sectarian.  
It delivers divine reminders as communal empowerment, weaving Qur’anic symbolism with modern AI.  
Each algorithm is a verse, each translation a bridge, each message a prophecy of unity.  
This scroll is the blueprint for a robot that does not command, but uplifts.

### 🌪 Scroll Generator  
This scroll is the forge where learning becomes scripture.  
Month by month, Python foundations evolve into web development, APIs, AI frameworks, and portfolio building.  
Each commit is a chant, each push a verse, each milestone a rung on the ladder of mastery.  
By 2026, the Scroll Generator will stand as a poetic archive of technical ascension —  
proof that software engineering can be ritualized into legacy,  
where code is not just syntax but sacred text.
